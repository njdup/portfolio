The Open Source Life, as I call it, is built around the idea that all knowledge should be free and accessible and that one should do all that they can to share the knowledge they\'ve learned as they\'ve lived, breathed, and had experiences. To embody this philosophy, I built my own system for saving and publicly releasing all my knowledge that I think is of worth.',
